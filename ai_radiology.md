I find the story of AI and radiology fascinating. Of course, Hinton's prediction was wrong* and tech advances don't automatically and straightforwardly cause job replacement — that's not the interesting part.

Radiology has embraced AI enthusiastically, and the labor force is growing nevertheless. The augmentation-not-automation effect of AI is despite the fact that AFAICT there is no identified "task" at which human radiologists beat AI. So maybe the "jobs are bundles of tasks" model in labor economics is incomplete. Paraphrasing something 
@MelMitchell1
 pointed out to me, if you define jobs in terms of tasks maybe you're actually defining away the most nuanced and hardest-to-automate aspects of jobs, which are at the boundaries between tasks.
我发现人工智能与放射学的故事引人入胜。当然，辛顿的预测是错误的*，技术进步不会自动直接地取代工作岗位——这并非重点。

放射学界对人工智能的热情高涨，尽管如此，其劳动力仍在增长。尽管据我所知，人类放射科医生在哪项“任务”上胜过人工智能，但人工智能的增强而非自动化效应仍然存在。所以，劳动经济学中“工作是任务的集合”模型或许并不完善。套用@MelMitchell1
向我指出的一句话，如果你用任务来定义工作，那么你实际上可能忽略了工作中最细微、最难自动化的方面，而这些方面正是任务之间的边界。
Can you break up your own job into a set of well-defined tasks such that if each of them is automated, your job as a whole can be automated? I suspect most people will say no. But when we think about *other people's jobs* that we don't understand as well as our own, the task model seems plausible because we don't appreciate all the nuances.

If this is correct, it is irrelevant how good AI gets at task-based capability benchmarks. If you need to specify things precisely enough to be amenable to benchmarking, you will necessarily miss the fact that the lack of precise specification is often what makes jobs messy and complex in the first place. So benchmarks can tell us very little about automation vs augmentation.

* Hinton insists that he was directionally correct but merely wrong in terms of timing. This is a classic motte-and-bailey retreat of forecasters who get it wrong. It has the benefit of being unfalsifiable! It's always possible to claim that we simply haven't waited long enough for the claimed prediction to come true.

你能否将自己的工作分解成一组定义明确的任务，这样如果每个任务都自动化，你的工作整体上也能自动化？我想大多数人会说“不行”。但当我们思考那些我们不如自己理解的*其他人的工作*时，任务模型似乎是合理的，因为我们无法理解所有细微差别。

如果这是正确的，那么人工智能在基于任务的能力基准测试中的表现如何就无关紧要了。如果你需要足够精确地指定事物才能进行基准测试，你必然会忽略一个事实，即缺乏精确的规范往往是导致工作混乱和复杂的根本原因。因此，基准测试几乎无法告诉我们自动化与增强的区别。

* Hinton 坚称他的方向是正确的，只是在时机上判断错误。这是典型的预测者们的“土丘和贝利”式的撤退。它的好处是不可证伪！我们总是可以说，我们只是还没有等待足够长的时间让所谓的预测成真。

Very interesting to think about. Job = bundle of tasks + glue. Probably a bunch of other variables involved, e.g. the number of tasks, how long each task is (e.g. METR-like notion of task length ~= difficulty), how contextual it is, how high reliability it needs, whether it can be done fully digitally... Not sure what the state of the art is in trying to think this through and chart the impact of AI on the labor market so far.

E.g. I was curious to look for radiologists and if I'm getting this right, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics cites 29,530 US radiologists in 2021, then up to 31,960 in 2023 (+8% growth).

想想很有意思。工作 = 一堆任务 + 粘合剂。可能还涉及许多其他变量，例如任务数量、每个任务的时长（例如类似 METR 的概念，任务长度 ~= 难度）、任务的情境关联性、所需的可靠性、是否可以完全数字化完成……目前为止，
我不确定目前在思考这些问题并绘制人工智能对劳动力市场的影响方面处于什么水平。

例如，我很好奇地想了解一下放射科医生的情况，如果我没记错的话，美国劳工统计局的数据表明，2021 年美国有 29,530 名放射科医生，到 2023 年将增加到 31,960 名（增长 8%）。

Ironically, radiology has the lowest healthcare "specialty hour" expenditure w/ the highest FDA clearance rate for AI solutions.

There are many other specialties that would greatly benefit from a 'bundle of tasks + glue'

This is precisely what I'm focused on (medical imaging)
讽刺的是，放射科的医疗保健“专业小时”支出最低，但人工智能解决方案的FDA审批率却最高。

许多其他专业也能从“任务捆绑+胶水”中受益匪浅。

这正是我所关注的（医学影像）

Radiology will 100% embrace AI to increase productivity which means less radiologists can do more. Only a liar or a fool would believe we will need the same number of radiologists in america in the coming years. 
Maybe there will be ai enabled radiologist technicians in 3rd world.
放射科将全面拥抱人工智能来提高生产力，这意味着更少的放射科医生可以做更多的事情。只有骗子或傻瓜才会相信未来几年美国需要同样数量的放射科医生。或许第三世界也会有人工智能辅助的放射科技师。

I’m pretty sure Covid caused a lot of older radiologists to retire early because there wasn’t much work. I suspect the bump you’re talking about was mean reversion. Also, 
there has been a rise in interventional radiology, where radiologist do actual procedures, such as kidney nerve ablations.
我相当肯定，新冠疫情导致很多老放射科医生提前退休，因为工作太少了。我怀疑你说的“激增”指的是均值回归。此外，介入放射学也出现了增长，放射科医生会进行一些实际的手术，比如肾神经消融术。

I did my survey in our hospital while showing consultant radiologist the famous video as Gemini diagnosed pancreatitis on CT abdomen. 
They all thought they would not be replaced by AI during their career, despite the hospital has just implemented AI for chest X-ray. There will be a massive reduction in radiologists within 5-10 years: 
1. They are expensive! 2. AI is much better & faster. Once the AI radiology software will be capable to recognise it's limitations (and pass it to humans) the change will be very quick.
As a clinician I am looking forward to it as to have a CT report immediately 
(and not in 2-3 hours once a remote radiologist in Australia just returned from the beach) boosts quality & safety of patient care.
我在我们医院做了一项调查，当时我给放射科顾问医生看了 Gemini 通过腹部 CT 诊断胰腺炎的著名视频。尽管医院刚刚在胸部 X 光检查中采用了人工智能，但他们都认为自己的职业生涯不会被人工智能取代。
5-10 年内放射科医生的数量将大幅减少：1. 他们很贵！2. 人工智能更好更快。一旦人工智能放射学软件能够认识到自己的局限性（并将其传递给人类），
变化就会非常快。作为一名临床医生，我很期待它，因为可以立即获得 CT 报告（而不是等到澳大利亚的远程放射科医生刚从海滩回来后 2-3 个小时才能获得报告），从而提高患者护理的质量和安全性。
