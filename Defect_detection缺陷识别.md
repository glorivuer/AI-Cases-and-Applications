 YOLO 🍎

Imagine a fruit grading process where apples move rapidly along a conveyor belt, and a vision system automatically evaluates their quality in real time.

Prompt for manufacturing line 🚀

"Create an 8-second ultra-realistic video of a single straight line of empty plastic bottles moving from left to right on a conveyor belt in a clean packaging facility.
Use a fixed top-down static camera with soft, bright lighting and a minimal industrial background. All bottles should be uncapped, unfilled, and standing perfectly upright, moving smoothly in a straight path with even spacing. Include a mix of pristine bottles and visibly damaged ones — some cracked, some crushed, or dented — but all should enter already defective. No bottle should wobble, tilt, or rotate. Motion should be blur-free and consistent, 
ideal for training AI models on defect classification in industrial bottling systems."


Fruits grading video prompt😍

"A top-down static camera view, slightly zoomed in above a moving conveyor belt carrying assorted fruits like apples, mangoes, and oranges. Some fruits appear ripe and vibrant, while a few show visible defects like bruises, dark spots, or cuts. The conveyor belt is black or dark grey, textured rubber, moving at a moderate speed. Lighting is bright and uniform. The fruits move continuously left to right under the camera. The scene should feel industrial and clean, like a quality control section of a fruit packaging facility. No hands, no people—just fruits and the conveyor belt."
