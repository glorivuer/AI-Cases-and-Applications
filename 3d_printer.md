With this AI, you can create your own 3D printed figures in minutes  https://x.com/techhalla/status/1920508642576494613

1.Letâ€™s start with the prompt, in this case for Midjourney v7. Itâ€™s super simple:
 mini [character] 3D figurine | isometric Blender model | plain white background
 Youâ€™ll find the prompts in the ALTs.
 mini Kratos 3D figurine | isometric Blender model | plain white background

2.Now we take the image to @tripoai  , upload it, and generate the 3D model.
Yep, itâ€™s that simple! You can even add a rig (if the model supports it), animate it, tweak the polygon count... itâ€™s wild! Let me show you how you can order your 3D printed figure. ðŸ‘‡

Once your 3D model is generated, you can click the "Print & Deliver" button, choose the type and size of the figure, enter your info, and thatâ€™s it. Theyâ€™ll ship it right to your door!

Check out the ones I ordered (unboxing included):

Now go to 
@tripoai
, upload the images we just generated, and finally use the retopologize feature to reduce polygons and export in FBX format.
